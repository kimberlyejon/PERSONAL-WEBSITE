                                When I was in grade school, I loved art.<sup>1</sup> <u>Drawing, painting, and coloring</u> were my favorite things to do. <sup>2</sup> I enjoyed them so much, and I was good at them.<sup>3</sup> I remember my first contest was a coloring contest, and I won second place.<sup>4</sup> That made me even more excited about art.<sup>5</sup> The next year, I joined a drawing contest during Teachers' Day and won third place.<sup>6</sup> This made me realize that art was something I was good at and loved doing. <sup>7</sup>
                                I continued drawing and exploring different ways to express myself through art.<sup>8</sup> As I got older, I started learning new skills, like designing and creating things like crafting.<sup>9</sup> My creativity grew, and I wanted to try making things like <b>jewelry and other crafts.</b><sup>10</sup> Then, I decided to try making <u><b>handmade keychains, phone charms, and bracelets using beads.</b></u><sup>11</sup> What started as a simple hobby of collecting beads became a fun project where I could create my designs.<sup>12</sup>
                                The more I created, the more I enjoyed it.<sup>13</sup> I thought about turning these skills into a small business.<sup>14</sup> It seemed like something that could be fun and profitable.<sup>15</sup> I began thinking about different ways to improve my designs and make them even more unique.<sup>16</sup> Now, I make keychains with various designs.<sup>17</sup> Some are simple, while others are more detailed. <sup>18</sup> I love experimenting with new ideas and seeing what works.<sup>19</sup>
                                I also learned another skill from my mom, who is a talented sewer.<sup>20</sup> She taught me how to sew when I was young.<sup>21</sup> When I had a <strong>stitching class</strong> in high school, I was able to keep up because of what she had taught me.<sup>22</sup> Learning from my mom has helped me develop my <em>stitching</em> skills, and I now enjoy making little fabric projects.<sup>23</sup> Overall, <em>my creative skills have helped me grow</em>, and I hope to keep improving and learning new things.<sup>24</sup>

                                One of my favorite hobbies is <b>dancing.</b><sup>1</sup> I learned to dance when I was in 2nd grade because my cousin taught me, and I learned more about dancing up until now. <sup>2</sup> It doesn't matter whether I am in a dance class or just at home, dancing makes me feel free and happy. <sup>3</sup>
                                I enjoy learning new dance moves and improving my skills.<sup>4</sup> The more I practice, the more I feel confident in my movements.<sup>5</sup> Dancing is a great way to release stress and have fun.<sup>6</sup> It allows me to be in the moment and forget about other things for a while.<sup>7</sup> I also enjoy how dancing helps me become more aware of my body.<sup>8</sup>
                                It has taught me how to move in different ways and increase my flexibility. <sup>9</sup> I like trying out different dance styles, from hip-hop to contemporary, and I love how each style offers something new. <sup>10</sup> Singing is another hobby that brings me a lot of joy.<sup>11</sup> I love singing along to my favorite songs and feeling the music. <sup>12</sup>
                                Singing helps me express my emotions in a way that feels natural.<sup>13</sup> Whether I’m singing with friends or just by myself, it makes me feel happy and relaxed. <sup>14</sup> Sometimes I even try recording myself to hear how I can improve my voice.<sup>15</sup> Though I may not be the best singer, I love singing because it allows me to connect with the music.<sup>16</sup> <u><em>Cosplaying</em> is another hobby I became interested in last 2022.</u><sup>17</sup>
                                I have always been a <em><strong>fan of anime and movies, and cosplaying lets me bring my favorite characters to life.</strong></em> <sup>18</sup> I enjoy making or customizing costumes to look just like the characters I admire.<sup>19</sup> It’s fun to put everything together, from the outfit to the makeup, to make it as realistic as possible.<sup>20</sup>
                                Cosplaying has also introduced me to a new community of people who share the same passion.<sup>21</sup> I love meeting other cosplayers and talking about our favorite characters.<sup>22</sup> The process of cosplaying is creative and exciting, and I hope to keep doing it in the future.<sup>23</sup> It has made me more confident and allowed me to show my creative side.<sup>24</sup> With every new costume, I learn something new and grow in my skills. <sup>25</sup>

                                Lately, I’ve been interested in collecting <u><b>Popmart figures.</b></u> <sup>1</sup> These little figures are adorable and have unique designs that I find fascinating. <sup>2</sup> <em><strong>Figures like Hirono, Kubo, and Skullpanda</strong></em> have become my favorites.<sup>3</sup>
                                I enjoy collecting them because each one has its special charm.<sup>4</sup> The details of the figures, like their faces and accessories, make them look like tiny works of art.<sup>5</sup> Collecting these figures has become a hobby I’m passionate about, and I spend time looking for new ones to add to my collection.<sup>6</sup>
                                The thrill of finding a rare figure makes it even more exciting.<sup>7</sup> I like the challenge of trying to complete a set or finding figures that are hard to find.<sup>8</sup> It feels like a treasure hunt, and I love that. <sup>9</sup> Another part of collecting Popmart figures is learning about the artists who designed them.<sup>10</sup>
                                I’m interested in the stories behind each character and how they were created.<sup>11</sup> This adds another layer of enjoyment to the hobby.<sup>12</sup> I also enjoy talking to other collectors about Popmart figures.<sup>13</sup> It’s fun to share what I’ve learned and hear about other people’s collections.<sup>14</sup> Over time, my collection has grown, and I’m proud of it.<sup>15</sup>
                                I take care of each figure and especially display them.<sup>16</sup> Every time I add a new figure, I feel a sense of accomplishment.<sup>17</sup> These figures, like Hirono, Kubo, and Skullpanda, have become more than just toys to me.<sup>18</sup> 
                                They represent my passion for collecting and my interest in the art behind them.<sup>19</sup> Collecting Popmart figures has also made me more interested in other types of collectibles.<sup>20</sup>
                                It’s amazing how much creativity goes into making each figure, and I love exploring different collections.<sup>21</sup> <u>This interest has become something I’m truly passionate about, and I’m excited to see where it takes me.</u><sup>22</sup>
